                <h1>Top 3 open source libraries for Node.js</h1>
                <small>08/11/2023</small>
                    
                <P>Node.js has become more and more popular as a framework because provides quick and efficient solutions for back-end development and integrates well with front-end platforms.</P>
                 <P>Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009, Node.js is actively maintained by a large community as an open source project. It enables software and app developers to build fast and scalable web applications using just a few lines of code. Node.js Foundation</P>   
                    <P>The world of custom software development constantly evolves with new trends, techniques, and languages. But, with Node.js, app development is significantly simplified.</P>
                    <P>In this article, I collated a list of the useful open source libraries that you can use in your upcoming Node.js project.</P>

                    <H2>ExpressJS</H2>

                    <P>Express.js is a go-to, minimalist framework for Node.js web applications. In recent years, it has been a go to framework to write server side code for the applications that want to use and leverage Node.js.</P>
                    <P>It is actively maintained by a great community, now supports almost all ES6 features and is used by both big companies and startups. There is no shortage of web frameworks when it comes to Nodejs and Express has survived the popularity phase so far.</P>
                    
                    <H2>AdonisJS</H2>

                    <P>It is a complete MVC Nodejs framework (other than Sails) that runs on all major operating systems without a problem. . It offers a stable ecosystem to write server-side web applications so you can focus on business needs over finalizing which package to choose or not.</P>
                    <P>It differs from other Nodejs web frameworks such as Express and Koa in manner that those frameworks are mostly routing libraries with thin layer of middleware on top</P>
                    <P>AdonisJS is combination of multiple packages that work together gracefully integrate with the application. For example, it provides a built-in ORM that is works well with SQL databases such as Postgres and MySQL. It helps to create efficient SQL- queries and is based on active record idea. Its query builder is easy to learn and allows us to build simple queries quickly.</P>

                    <H2>MomentJS</H2>

                    <p>The standard JavaScript API already comes with the Date object for working with dates and times. However, this object is not very user-friendly when it comes to printing and formatting dates.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, MomentJS has become a go to module to use with NodeJS applications to parse, validate, manipulate and format date when building APIs and storing them as data in a preferred database. It is lightweight library and now supports ECMAScript 6.</p>
